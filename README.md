## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### Course & Certification Warning
Many YouTube channels and platforms promote their own courses and certifications. I recommend focusing on **industry-recognized certifications**:
- CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)
- eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)
- OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
- CISSP, CompTIA Security+, PNPT

### Hardware & Tools Warning
Making or purchasing hacking tools (Flipper Zero, WiFi Pineapple, etc.) **without knowing the basics is useless**. Focus on:
1. Learning fundamentals first
2. Practicing in legal environments
3. Understanding theory before buying hardware
4. Ensuring legal authorization

### Malicious Tools Warning
Some promoted "hacking tools" can contain:
- Backdoors
- Botnets
- Keyloggers
- Ransomware
- Crypto miners

**Always:**
- Download from trusted sources only
- Check GitHub stars, forks, and community trust
- Read source code or use AI to analyze it
- Test in virtual machines/sandboxed environments
- Scan with VirusTotal

### Online Safety
- Verify people through OSINT before trusting advice
- Check LinkedIn, GitHub, and multiple social platforms
- Fact-check AI-generated information
- Be skeptical of "too good to be true" claims
- Beware of Discord scammers and impersonators

> "The best hackers aren't the ones with the most expensive gadgets—they're the ones who deeply understand security principles and can think creatively with any tool at their disposal."
